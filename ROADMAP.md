# Roadmap

invAIriant is at **v0.2.3**. The core protocol — evidence rules, severity
model, lenses, schemas, prompts, the skill, and the CLI — is stable. **v0.2 was
hardening and reach — bounded audit scopes over the same pipeline, not new
surface.**

## Guardrail: no new core lenses

The 28 lenses across 7 packs are the stable vocabulary. v0.2 shipped with
**zero** new core lenses, and that guardrail holds forward. New domain
judgment, when a project needs it, goes through a custom project lens
([docs/lens-taxonomy.md](docs/lens-taxonomy.md)) — not the core packs.

## v0.3 — hardening & reach (planned)

**Packaging & distribution**
- **On PyPI** *(done)* — [`pip install invairiant`](https://pypi.org/project/invairiant/)
  is live; the wheel/sdist bundle the framework the CLI needs (a CI packaging
  smoke guards it). Uploads run over **GitHub Trusted Publishing** (OIDC, no
  token) via [`publish.yml`](.github/workflows/publish.yml), so cutting a release
  auto-publishes that version. Setup + manual fallback:
  [docs/publishing.md](docs/publishing.md).
- Publish the GitHub Action to the Marketplace (the `action.yml` already works
  via `uses: mindicator/invairiant@<ref>` and now understands the bounded
  scopes — `scope`/`pr`/`commit`/`path`/`narrow`).

**Evidence base**
- More worked case studies across project types (SaaS, data platform, infra),
  ideally from real, opted-in diffs.
- A screenshot / GIF of the `audit-pr → PR comment` flow.

**Memory & trends**
- `history --json` for tooling; a compact lens-score-trend view.
- Surface recurring findings as suggested lint rules / CI gates.

## Not planned

- New lenses in the core packs.
- The CLI ever running a lens, producing a finding, or scoring — it stays a
  judgment-free seatbelt.
- Replacing human review, tests, SAST/DAST, threat modeling, or formal methods.

## Shipped in v0.2

- **Scope resolvers — the audit target beyond PRs.**
  `invairiant collect --scope {working,range,commit,module,adr,rp,repo}` turns a
  scope pin into a **bounded file set**; the whole evidence bundle is computed
  over that set only. Fails closed when a scope can't be bounded (and the
  doc-anchored `adr`/`rp` scopes refuse references that resolve too broadly — a
  relative bound, not just an absolute cap), and records the boundary in a
  `resolved_scope` block.
- **Skill commands** `audit-range`, `audit-commit`, `audit-module`, `audit-adr`,
  `audit-rp` (a refactoring proposal ↔ code — would it break invariants?) —
  thin scope-selectors over the **same** four-stage pipeline — plus the
  unifying **audit target** concept (pinned scope + evidence bundle + selected
  lenses + report type) in the skill and methodology. Bounded scopes, not vibes;
  **no new lenses.**

## Shipped in v0.1

- The protocol: evidence rules, severity model, 28 lenses / 7 packs, schemas,
  templates, prompt pack.
- The `/invairiant` skill — Claude Code · Codex · Cursor.
- The CLI: `init`, `collect`, `validate-config`, `validate-report`,
  `render-report`, `render-comment`, `ci-gate`, `record`, `history`.
- Committed, sanitized audit memory; two self-audits with a per-lens trend.
- Unit tests for the CLI (55) *(Unreleased → v0.1.x)*.
- CLI robustness — repo-root memory resolution, bounded `collect` on large
  repos, hardened secret redaction (CLOSE-001/002) *(Unreleased → v0.1.x)*.
- A reusable **GitHub Action** (`action.yml`) — validate + render summary +
  gate on S0/S1 *(Unreleased → v0.1.x)*.
